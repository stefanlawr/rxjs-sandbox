# RxJS Sandbox

[RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.

This repo contains various examples of RxJS operators for me to reference and learn from.
Note, RxJS contains over 100 operators. There's no way I'm learning all of these, so I'm focusing on ones that I'll be seeing / using more frequently.
